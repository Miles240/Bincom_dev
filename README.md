# Python Basic Developer Test

## Introduction
This Python Basic Developer Test is designed to assess your proficiency in Python programming, particularly in areas such as data analysis, algorithmic thinking, and database operations.

## Background
You have been provided with a web page showing the colors of dresses worn by Bincom staff members for the week. The objective is to analyze this data and derive insights to assist in the decision-making process for producing T-shirts for staff members.

## Requirements
To successfully complete this test, you will need:
- Basic knowledge of Python programming language
- Understanding of data structures and algorithms
- Familiarity with database operations, particularly PostgreSQL
- Proficiency in using libraries such as NumPy and Counter

## Tasks
1. **Mean Color:** Determine the average color of the dresses.
2. **Most Worn Color:** Identify the color that appears most frequently throughout the week.
3. **Median Color:** Find the middle color when all colors are arranged in order.
4. **Variance of Colors:** Calculate the spread or variability of colors.
5. **Probability of Choosing Red:** If a color is selected randomly, what's the chance it's red?
6. **Database Storage:** Save the colors and their frequencies in a PostgreSQL database.
7. **BONUS: Recursive Searching Algorithm:** Create a recursive algorithm to search for a user-entered number in a list of numbers.
8. **BONUS: Random Binary Number Conversion:** Generate a random 4-digit binary number and convert it to base 10.
9. **BONUS: Sum of Fibonacci Sequence:** Calculate the sum of the first 50 Fibonacci sequence numbers.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the provided Python script (`analysis.py`) in your preferred editor.
3. Update the script with your code to complete the tasks outlined in the comments.
4. Run the script (`python analysis.py`) to execute your code and see the results.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed and configured on your machine if you attempt the database storage task.
- Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools you find necessary to complete the tasks efficiently.

## Submission
Once you have completed the tasks, please submit your updated Python script (`analysis.py`) along with any additional files (if applicable) according to the submission instructions provided.

Good luck!
